### Hello world

*this is the what list*

For index.html to work you need to use a server:

## Running a local web server
1. Open a Terminal (e.g. by opening Spotlight and searching for "Terminal")

2. Navigate to the folder that contains your copy of this Git repository (By default, the terminal starts in your home directory. Use cd to change directories, pwd to show the current directory (path) and ls to show the content of the current directory.)

3. Once you're in the right directory, start a local webserver by running python -m SimpleHTTPServer

4. This server will run as long as you keep the Terminal window open. You can also quit the server process by pressing Ctrl+C.

5. Now, point your browser to http://localhost:8000/. (8000 is the custom port the server runs on.)
